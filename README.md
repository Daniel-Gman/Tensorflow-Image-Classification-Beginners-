# Tensorflow-Image-Classification-Beginners-
Beginner image classification for flowers using a CNN and tensorflow (Own trained model)

## Goal of this repo:
In this repo i followed some basic steps to build my own tensorflow driven CNN model for image recognition on flowers
This model is well trained for different flower detections
